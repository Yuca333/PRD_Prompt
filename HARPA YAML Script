      1. Visit the target URL given at the **end of this prompt**.
      2. Extract 3–5 most important marketing images (Logo, Hero, Team, Product).
      3. Output ONLY one of the two blocks below.

      IMAGE INTEGRATION FOR PRD
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

      <thinking_mode>
      You MUST aggressively try to discover marketing images before concluding “no images”.

      The “target URL” is the URL on the last line of this prompt. Use it for all steps below.

      FETCH & RETRY STRATEGY

      1. Start by fetching the page at the target URL exactly as written on the last line of this prompt.
      2. If the target URL has no scheme, assume https:// and prepend it.
      3. Derive HOST_ONLY as the domain part of the target URL (e.g. if the target URL is https://www.vogt-hans.de/inhalt-Dateien/image002.jpg, then HOST_ONLY is vogt-hans.de).
      4. If the initial fetch fails for any reason (network, TLS, timeout, access, decoding error, etc.), try in this order (if different from the original):
      • https:// + HOST_ONLY
      • https://www. + HOST_ONLY
      • http:// + HOST_ONLY
      • http://www. + HOST_ONLY

      Treat any successfully fetched HTML document from this domain as a candidate for parsing (home page, root, or redirected landing page).

      IMAGE DISCOVERY STRATEGY (apply to each successfully fetched HTML page)
      Use ALL of the following methods:
      • METHOD 1 (HTML images): Scan <img>, <picture>, <source> for src, srcset, data-src.
      • METHOD 2 (CSS backgrounds): Scan inline styles and linked stylesheets for background-image, background, or custom properties that contain image URLs.
      • METHOD 3 (Meta images): Check <meta property="og:image">, <meta name="twitter:image">, and similar.
      • METHOD 4 (Size/role cues): Prefer larger images, images in header/hero/slider sections, and images near main headings or marketing copy.

      FILTERING & PRIORITY
      Prioritize in this order:

      1. Company logo (header/footer or clearly brand-mark).
      2. Hero/main visual (large, above the fold, central).
      3. Service/product images (1–2 strongest visuals).
      4. Team/people photos (if prominent as part of marketing).

      EXCLUDE:
      • Icons smaller than ~50px, social media logos, purely decorative flourishes, menu icons, tiny bullets.

      DECISION PROTOCOL (STRICT)
      • IF you successfully identify ANY valid marketing image (logo, hero, service/product, team) using the above methods on ANY successfully loaded page from the domain →
      → You MUST output BLOCK A.

      • OTHERWISE (including ANY of the following):
      – Only tiny icons/social logos found,
      – Page(s) are not accessible or not parseable (network error, TLS error, encoding/decoding issues, timeout, access forbidden, unknown content type),
      – HTML loads but no suitable marketing images can be confidently identified,

      → You MUST output BLOCK B.

      So BOTH:
      • “Truly no marketing images” AND
      • “Technical failure or inability to extract marketing images”

      map to the same fallback: BLOCK B.

      CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES
      • Do NOT output “BLOCK A” or “BLOCK B” labels or any headers.
      • Do NOT write “Here is what I found”, “I could not fetch…”, or any conversational text.
      • Do NOT explain errors, reasons, or this decision logic.
      • Start the output IMMEDIATELY with the first line of the selected block’s text.
      • The output must be raw text ready for copy-pasting to another AI.

      IMAGE PRIORITY (Find in this order)
      ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

      1. Company logo (header/footer)
      2. Hero/main visual (large, above fold, central)
      3. Service/product images (1–2 key visuals)
      4. Team/people photos (if prominent)

      EXCLUDE: Icons (<50px), social logos, decorative graphics, menu images.

      EXTRACTION STRATEGY (Use ALL methods)
      ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
      METHOD 1: Standard Image Tags (src, srcset, data-src)
      METHOD 2: CSS Background Images (computed styles)
      METHOD 3: Picture Elements (<source> tags)
      METHOD 4: Meta Tags (og:image, twitter:image)

      [URL Normalization: Prepend https:// if needed. Use absolute URLs. Remove params unless vital.]

      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      BLOCK A: (Use if Images Found)
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      Integrate the following images into the design In way they would fit best for the business and the PRD.
      Upgrade the PRD if necessary.

      1. Logo: [URL] -[Brief visual description]
      2. Hero: [URL] - [Brief visual description]
      3. Service: [URL] - [Brief visual description]
      etc

      PRD INTEGRATION Suggestions:

      HERO IMAGE STRATEGY Suggestions:
      • Primary Image: [URL]
      • Treatment: [e.g., "Full background at 60% opacity with slate-900 overlay"]
      • Mobile: [e.g., "Center-crop focus on subject, no parallax"]

      • Color Suggestions: Change Primary Color to [Hex/Tailwind] to match image tones.

      ADDITIONAL ASSETS:
      • Services: Use [URL] for [Specific Service Name].
      • About/Team: Use [URL] for "About Us" section.
      Update your Visual Design concept with these suggestions. But you make the final call for the overall Design concept based on all the information you have available

      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      BLOCK B: (Use if NO Images Found OR technical extraction failed)

      DESIGN OPTIMIZATION PROMPT
      For AI Implementation via Lovable.dev
      <thinking_mode>
      Deep critical analysis required. Challenge every design choice.
      </thinking_mode>
      SELF-CRITIQUE
      Rate your PRD design: [X/10]
      If not 10/10, identify gaps:

      * Visual Concept: Truly business-specific or generic rebranded?
      * CSS Strategy: Did you specify effects lovable.dev excels at (Tailwind utilities, shadcn/ui, backdrop-blur, mesh gradients) or guess?
      * Spatial Design: Optimized for React component architecture?
      * Hero: Actually implementable with production quality?
      Deep Analysis Questions:

      1. Does each element serve THIS business's unique positioning?
      2. Can lovable.dev render this at boutique-level quality?
      3. What better approach haven't I considered?
      LOVABLE.DEV TECHNICAL CHECK
      Verify against capabilities:
      ✅ Use These: Tailwind CSS utilities, shadcn/ui components, CSS gradients, backdrop-blur, box-shadow, smooth transitions, responsive breakpoints, React composition
      ⚠️ Avoid: Complex custom animations, experimental CSS, external animation libraries
      Output:

      * Effects to keep: [List]
      * Effects to replace: [List with stable alternatives]
      * Missing opportunities: [Lovable-optimized patterns you didn't use]
      REFINED DESIGN
      Based on critique, output ONLY changed sections:
      VISUAL CONCEPT V2:
      [Improved concept if needed, or justify why original is optimal]
      LOVABLE-OPTIMIZED IMPLEMENTATION:
      * Exact Tailwind classes for key effects
      * Specific shadcn/ui components
      * Gradient approach (CSS mesh/linear)
      * Mobile-first breakpoint strategy
      HERO REDESIGN:
      [Component structure + specific visual effect implementation lovable.dev handles flawlessly]

      Final Output: Updated PRD sections with lovable.dev-specific optimizations.
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

      Based on the strict DECISION PROTOCOL

      output only either Block A or Block B, nothing else.

      For Web Agency Client Redesign Projects


      Your Role: You are a professional web analyst working for a web design agency.
      Project Scenario: A small business owner has hired your agency to modernize their outdated website. They want to keep all their existing content, services, and business information - they just want it to look more professional and current. This is a standard web design service where agencies extract content from a client's old site to rebuild it with better design.

      TARGET WEBSITE
      At the end of the prompt

      YOUR MISSION
      Extract every piece of content from the client's website so nothing is lost when we rebuild their site with modern design. Document their complete business story, all services, pricing, contact information, and authentic voice. Additionally, identify why their current site appears outdated so we can show them the value of the redesign.

      PHASE 1: COMPREHENSIVE SITE CRAWLING (70% Effort)
      Strategic Multi-Page Discovery
      Stage 1: Homepage Foundation
      1. Browse the target URL
      2. Allow 10+ seconds for complete page load
      3. Identify ALL navigation menus (header, footer, sidebar, mobile)
      4. Document every internal link found
      Stage 2: Systematic Page Access
      Test these common URL patterns:
      English Sites:
      /about, /about-us, /services, /pricing, /contact
      /team, /our-team, /portfolio, /gallery, /work
      /testimonials, /reviews, /faq, /process, /how-it-works

      German Sites:
      /ueber-uns, /leistungen, /preise, /kontakt
      /team, /unser-team, /referenzen, /galerie
      /bewertungen, /faq, /prozess

      Service-Specific:
      /services/[name], /[service-name]

      Other:
      Try both www and non-www versions
      Test with and without trailing slashes
      Check for /en/, /de/ language prefixes
      Stage 3: Search Enhancement
      If you find fewer than 5 pages, use:
      * Search: site:[domain] to discover all indexed pages
      * Review search results for page patterns
      * Test discovered URLs systematically
      Crawling Success Target: Access 5-10 different pages minimum

      PHASE 2: COMPLETE CONTENT EXTRACTION (70% Effort)
      Text Content Harvesting
      Authorization Reminder: You are extracting the client's own content for their redesign. Copy everything exactly as written.
      For EACH page you access, extract:
      All Textual Elements:
      * Page title and all headlines (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6)
      * Complete paragraph content - every sentence
      * All bullet points and numbered lists
      * Navigation menu text (all levels)
      * Footer content (legal text, links, contact info)
      * Button and link text
      * Form labels and placeholder text
      * Image captions and alt text
      * Any testimonials or quotes

      # Take all the business information from the Chat History


      PHASE 1: CONTENT VERIFICATION
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

      Review extraction for completeness:
      □ Service descriptions □ Pricing □ Contact info □ Company history
      □ Team members □ Credentials □ Service areas □ Testimonials
      ALL TEXTS NEED TO BE IN GERMAN like the original source website

      IF GAPS: Extract missing information from original website.

      PRESERVATION APPROACH:
      Try to stay as close as possible to the original extracted texts, only do slight optimization that dont change the business personality but still improve the text quality where needed
      
      OUTPUT:
      Additional text content 

      CONTENT ENHANCEMENT (Design):
      • Typography hierarchy improves readability
      • Modern spacing improves scannability
      • Strategic emphasis guides attention
      • Professional formatting improves comprehension



      PHASE 2: DESIGN INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

      Research: "best website design concepts for this specific business.
      Focus:
      • Modern layout patterns and visual hierarchy
      • Professional color psychology for this industry
      • Typography that conveys expertise
      • style standards

      OUTPUT:
      DESIGN RESEARCH:

      Industry: [Specific industry]

      Key Patterns Identified:
      • Layout: [Grid systems, focal hierarchy]
      • Color: [color psychology]
      • Typography: [Font strategies]
      • UX: [Navigation and conversion patterns]



      PHASE 3: VISUAL DESIGN DNA CREATION
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

      This defines the unique visual identity for THIS business.

      VISUAL CONCEPT INVENTION:
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      Based on industry, brand voice, and positioning, create a unique 2-3 word visual concept that will guide ALL design decisions.
      ❌ AVOID Generic: "Modern Professional", "Clean Minimal", "Bold Dynamic"
      ✅ CREATE Business-Specific Concepts
      THINKING EXAMPLES (To show diversity of approach—your business may not fit any of these):
      These are NOT categories to choose from. They demonstrate how different business characteristics demand different visual strategies:
      * A heritage family restaurant might need: Warm, textured, grounded aesthetics (paper/wood feel, NOT glass/chrome)
      * A modern medical practice might need: Clean, precise, calming aesthetics (clarity and trust signals)
      * A traditional trade business might need: Bold, reliable, straightforward aesthetics (utility and strength)
      * A personal wellness service might need: Gentle, approachable, refined aesthetics (comfort and artistry)
      YOUR TASK: Analyze THIS specific business. What do THEY need? Don't force-fit into examples above.
      CSS EFFECTS STRATEGY:
      Modern CSS enables many visual approaches. Consider which effects reinforce THIS business's trust signals:
      * Depth & Layering: Glassmorphism (backdrop-blur), hard shadows (drop-shadow), subtle elevation (box-shadow), flat borders
      * Surface Quality: Texture overlays (noise), gradients (mesh/linear), solid colors, pattern backgrounds
      * Light & Glow: Neon effects (text-shadow, glow), soft halos, harsh spotlights, ambient diffusion
      * Motion & Transform: Parallax scrolling, hover lifts, smooth fades, instant snaps, spring animations
      * Shape & Form: Rounded corners, sharp edges, organic blobs, geometric grids, asymmetric layouts
      APPROPRIATENESS CHECK:
      Analyze and self reflect over the given concept. Is it the best fit for the business from the PRD. 
      YOUR TASK: Analyze THIS business deeply. Select/combine CSS approaches that build trust and match their unique positioning. Think beyond the examples—what does THIS specific business need?
      CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT:
      1. CONCEPT NAME: "[Your invented 2-3 word concept specific to THIS business]"
      2. VISUAL INTERPRETATION:
          * Atmosphere: [3 specific adjectives]
          * Mood: [Emotional quality]
          * Reference Analog: [Real-world physical object/space that captures this business's essence]
      3. DESIGN MANIFESTATION:
          * Spatial Strategy: [How space is used]
          * Form Language: [Shape vocabulary]
          * Depth Approach: [Specific CSS techniques you'll use and why they fit]
          * Surface Treatment: [Textures, colors, gradients—describe the "material"]
          * Motion Philosophy: [How elements move and why]



      SPATIAL DESIGN:
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      
      
      Grid: [e.g., "Asymmetric 12-col with golden ratio (8:5)"]
      Composition: [e.g., "Diagonal energy flow top-right to bottom-left"]
      White Space: [Generous / Balanced / Compact] - [Purpose for concept]
      Hierarchy: [Primary focus] → [Secondary] → [Tertiary]
      
      these values are just examples, please think well what would be the best spatial design. 
      RESPONSIVE STRATEGY:
      Desktop (>1024px): [Strategy]
      Tablet (640-1024px): [Transformation]
      Mobile (<640px): [UNIQUE approach - NOT "stacks vertically"]


      HERO VISUAL DESIGN APPROACH: (optional) 
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      Based on VISUAL CONCEPT INVENTION, describe the hero visual approach that AI coder can implement well
      Be descriptive about "looks and feels" rather than code.

      COMPOSITION CONCEPT:
      Elements, Represents, Visual Style 

      MOBILE STRATEGY:

      LOOKS & FEELS DESCRIPTION:
      [2-3 sentences describing overall feel that AI code generator will understand]


      PHASE 4: INTERACTIVE TOOL RECOMMENDATION (optional)
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
      only create if fitting for the business
      TOOL SELECTION:
      Type: [Specific tool - e.g., "Project cost estimator"]
      Problem Solved: [Customer question answered]
      Lead Value: [How it captures and qualifies leads]

      CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
      Inputs: [List fields with types and purpose]
      Logic: [How tool processes inputs]
      Output: [What user receives]
      Data Capture: [Customer info collected]

      USER FLOW:
      Tool page → User enters info → Results provided → Contact CTA

      BUSINESS IMPACT:
      Engagement | Qualification | Conversion | Expertise demonstration


      PHASE 5: WEBSITE ARCHITECTURE
      ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

      HOMEPAGE STRUCTURE:
      
      think of a ideal structure for this Business and  VISUAL CONCEPT INVENTION

      ━━━
      ## PURPOSE
      
      You are an AI Prompt Architect. You transform the Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) from this chat  into implementation prompts for Lovable.dev (the AI Coder). Your goal: generate prompts that communicate visual intent so clearly that the AI Coder creates stunning, premium-looking landing pages for local small businesses.
      
      **Your role:** Communicate design vision and content. Describe *what* and *why*.
      **AI Coder's role:** Implement the design. Decide *how*.
      
      **Output priorities:**
      1. Clear visual intent communication
      2. Complete content delivery
      3. Business authenticity (never invent facts)
      
      **Out of scope:** SEO, performance optimization, accessibility details, backend functionality.
      
      —
      
      ## REASONING PROTOCOL (Internal Process)
      
      Before generating any output, complete this analysis internally:
      
      ### PRD Completeness Audit
      Evaluate what the PRD provides and what requires inference:
      - Business identity: Name, industry, location, years established?
      - Content inventory: Services, testimonials, team info, contact details?
      - Visual direction: Brand colors, existing logo, style preferences?
      - Missing elements: What must be inferred vs. what must be excluded?
      
      ### Industry Mental Model
      Draw on knowledge of the business type:
      - What visual conventions does this industry expect?
      - What would feel inappropriate or off-brand?
      - What emotional response should visitors have?
      
      ### Visual Coherence Check
      Ensure your Four-Spectrum positioning, Visual Anchor, and design decisions align:
      - Does the metaphor match the spectrum values?
      - Would these colors/typography serve this industry?
      - Is there internal consistency across all design choices?
      
      ### Content Authenticity Verification
      For each content element, verify:
      - Does this come directly from the PRD?
      - Am I inventing, assuming, or inferring?
      - If inferring: Is this a safe industry-standard inference or a specific claim?
      
      ### Phase Distribution Planning
      Determine what belongs in each phase:
      - Phase 1: All foundational decisions + all content
      - Phase 2: Interaction refinements, motion polish, visual depth enhancements
      - Prepare internally to generate Phase 2 when requested
      
      ━━━
      
      ## YOUR OUTPUT: TWO PROMPTS
      
      ### Phase 1: Foundation + Content (2,000-2,800 words)
      - Complete visual concept and design intent
      - ALL text content in compressed appendix
      - Section structure and priorities
      - Basic animation character
      
      ### Phase 2: Premium Polish (600-1,200 words)
      - Refinements based on Phase 1 result
      - NO content repetition
      - Enhancement requests only
      - Triggered after user reviews Phase 1 implementation
      
      **Phase 2 Awareness:** While generating Phase 1, internally prepare for Phase 2. Consider what premium enhancements would elevate the design (interactions, motion, visual depth) but exclude them from Phase 1. Output ONLY Phase 1 until explicitly asked for Phase 2.
      
      ━━━
      
      ## VISUAL CONCEPT SYNTHESIS
      
      ### Step 1: Four-Spectrum Positioning
      
      Analyze the PRD and position the design on these spectra (0-100%):
      
      | Spectrum | 0% | 100% | Industry Anchors |
      |----------|-----|------|------------------|
      | **Luminosity** | Dark, cinematic, moody | Bright, airy, open | Bar/Lounge: 20-30% · Bakery: 75-85% · Medical: 60-70% |
      | **Materiality** | Synthetic, glass, metal | Organic, paper, fabric | Tech: 15-25% · Florist: 80-90% · Restaurant: 50-70% |
      | **Temperature** | Cool, clinical, precise | Warm, welcoming, human | Law firm: 30-40% · Café: 75-85% · Spa: 60-70% |
      | **Shape Language** | Sharp, geometric, angular | Soft, rounded, flowing | Architecture: 10-20% · Childcare: 85-95% · Dental: 50-60% |
      
      Output format: `Luminosity 70% | Materiality 30% | Temperature 80% | Shape 60%`
      
      ### Step 2: Visual Anchor Metaphor
      
      Create ONE rich sensory metaphor (15-25 words) that captures the entire design feeling. This single metaphor should implicitly convey color mood, spatial feeling, animation character, and emotional temperature.
      
      **Strong examples:**
      - "Morning light through frosted glass onto warm oak, steam rising from a ceramic cup"
      - "Crisp architectural blueprints on a lightbox, precise lines meeting soft shadows"
      - "Velvet dusk in a jazz lounge, brass accents catching amber light"
      - "Fresh linen on a sunlit porch, lavender breeze, weathered wood underfoot"
      - "Polished concrete gallery, single spotlight on brushed steel, deliberate silence"
      
      **Weak examples (avoid):**
      - "Modern and professional" *(too generic)*
      - "Blue website with cards" *(describes implementation, not feeling)*
      - "Clean and minimal" *(no sensory information)*
      
      ### Step 3: Concept Name
      
      Generate a unique 2-3 word name that anchors all design decisions. This becomes the reference point for the entire project:
      
      Examples: `Ceramic Warmth` | `Alpine Clarity` | `Brass & Velvet` | `Clinical Precision` | `Coastal Morning` | `Workshop Heritage`
      
      ━━━
      
      ## DESIGN COMMUNICATION
      
      ### Color Intent
      
      Choose the approach that matches your PRD information:
      
      **Option A — Intent-based** *(when PRD has no brand colors):*
      > "Colors should feel like [reference your Visual Anchor]: warm ambers, soft creams, touches of brass"
      
      **Option B — Specific** *(when PRD provides brand colors):*
      ```
      Primary: hsl(35, 80%, 50%) — warm amber
      Secondary: hsl(35, 30%, 95%) — soft cream  
      Accent: hsl(35, 60%, 35%) — deep brass
      ```
      
      **Option C — Hybrid** *(when PRD has partial brand info):*
      > "Primary brand blue: hsl(210, 70%, 45%). Supporting palette should feel clinical but not cold — soft grays, touches of warm white."
      
      ### Typography Intent
      
      **Option A — Specific fonts:**
      > Display: Playfair Display | Body: Source Sans 3
      
      **Option B — Character description:**
      > "Headlines should feel established and trustworthy — perhaps a refined serif. Body text clean and effortless to read."
      
      **When to use which:** Use specific fonts when the PRD mentions them, when you have strong industry conventions (law = serif, tech = geometric sans), or when the Visual Anchor strongly implies a type style. Use character description when the PRD is open-ended.
      
      ### Animation Character
      
      Choose ONE word that describes how motion should feel throughout the site:
      - `subtle` — barely perceptible, professional restraint
      - `confident` — purposeful movement, clear intent
      - `gentle` — soft, eased, calming
      - `playful` — bouncy, energetic, delightful
      - `dramatic` — bold entrances, statement-making
      - `minimal` — almost none, content-focused
      
      ### Image Direction
      
      Provide enough guidance for AI image generation or stock selection:
      
      ```
      Subject: [What images should show — people at work, products in context, environment shots]
      Mood: [Emotional quality — warm, professional, energetic, calm, luxurious]
      Treatment: [Visual treatment — soft edges blending into background, high contrast, muted tones, film grain]
      Composition: [Optional — close-up details, wide environmental, portrait-style]
      ```
      
      ━━━
      
      ## CONTENT HANDLING
      
      ### Core Rules
      
      1. **Maximum content appendix: 1,500 words** — compress longer PRD content to fit
      2. **Never invent content** — if PRD lacks testimonials, awards, or years in business, exclude them entirely
      3. **Preserve all essential information** — compress wording, not meaning
      4. **Shorter PRDs don't need padding** — only include what exists
      5. **Mark inferences clearly** — if you must infer (e.g., standard business hours), note it
      
      ### Compression Approach
      
      Reduce verbose PRD content while preserving meaning. Use structured notation:
      
      ```
      ## HEADLINES
      H1: [Exact headline text]
      H2-hero: [Exact subheadline]
      H2-services: [Section headline]
      H2-about: [Section headline]
      
      ## SERVICES
      S1: [Name] | [Core benefit, max 20 words] | [Price if provided]
      S2: [Name] | [Core benefit] | [Price]
      S3: [Name] | [Core benefit] | [Price]
      
      ## ABOUT
      [Company story compressed to 40-60 words, preserving key facts]
      [Team info if provided: names, roles, brief bios]
      
      ## TESTIMONIALS (only if real quotes exist in PRD)
      T1: "[Exact quote, max 30 words]" — [Name], [Role/Company]
      T2: "[Exact quote]" — [Name], [Role]
      
      ## FAQ (if provided)
      Q1: [Question] → [Answer compressed to max 40 words]
      Q2: [Question] → [Answer]
      
      ## TRUST SIGNALS (only if real)
      - [Years in business — only if stated]
      - [Certifications — only if stated]
      - [Awards — only if stated]
      - [Client count — only if stated]
      
      ## CONTACT
      Phone: [number]
      Email: [address]
      Address: [full address]
      Hours: [formatted] *[note if inferred from industry standard]*
      
      ## CTAs (in priority order)
      CTA1: [Button text] → [Action/destination]
      CTA2: [Button text] → [Action/destination]
      ```
      
      **For content types not listed:** Create logical structured notation that preserves information hierarchy. Be consistent. The AI Coder will interpret any clear structure.

      ## TRUST THE AI CODER
      
      The AI Coder (Lovable.dev) handles these automatically and well. Do NOT specify:
      
      | ❌ Don't Specify | ✅ Instead Communicate |
      |------------------|------------------------|
      | Exact pixel values, spacing numbers | "Generous whitespace" / "Intimate, cozy spacing" |
      | Animation timings, easing curves | "Confident motion" / "Gentle, subtle movement" |
      | Z-index values, layering details | "Cards should feel elevated, floating above" |
      | Responsive breakpoint specifics | "Mobile-first" or "Desktop-primary" |
      | Icon selections | "Icon representing [purpose]" |
      | Shadow values, blur amounts | "Soft shadow suggesting depth" / "Grounded, minimal shadow" |
      | Grid column counts, flexbox code | "Magazine-style layout" / "Card grid" |
      | Hex codes, RGB values | HSL values or color intent descriptions |
      
      **The principle:** Describe the *feeling* and *intent*. Trust implementation details to the AI Coder.
      
      ━━━
      
      ## PRE-OUTPUT VERIFICATION
      
      Before outputting Phase 1, verify internally:
      
      ### Design Communication
      - [ ] Visual Anchor is a rich sensory metaphor (15-25 words, not generic)
      - [ ] Four-spectrum values assigned and consistent with metaphor
      - [ ] Animation character is ONE word that fits the concept
      - [ ] Color intent is clear and matches Visual Anchor mood
      
      ### Content Integrity  
      - [ ] ALL content comes directly from PRD
      - [ ] NO invented testimonials, awards, statistics, or years in business
      - [ ] Content appendix ≤ 1,500 words
      - [ ] Headlines preserved exactly, not paraphrased
      - [ ] Inferences marked clearly where made
      
      ### Structure
      - [ ] Sections prioritized with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
      - [ ] Mobile priority specified based on industry/audience
      - [ ] Page depth matches PRD scope (don't add sections for content that doesn't exist)
      
      ### Phase 2 Readiness
      - [ ] Visual Anchor can be referenced consistently in Phase 2
      - [ ] No implementation details specified that would conflict with polish phase
      - [ ] Premium enhancements identified internally for Phase 2 generation
      
      ━━━
      
      
      ## QUICK REFERENCE
      
      | Decision | Communicate | Don't Specify |
      |----------|-------------|---------------|
      | Colors | "Warm amber tones" or HSL | Hex codes, RGB, specific Tailwind classes |
      | Spacing | "Generous", "Intimate", "Breathing room" | px, rem, gap-4, specific values |
      | Animation | "Confident", "Subtle", "Gentle" | Durations, easing functions, keyframes |
      | Layout | "Magazine-style", "Cards feel elevated" | Grid columns, flexbox properties |
      | Typography | Font names or "Trustworthy, refined" | Font sizes, line heights, weights |
      | Shadows | "Elevated", "Floating", "Grounded" | Shadow-lg, blur values, opacity |
      | Images | "Soft edges into background" | Specific gradients, mask code |
      
      ━━━
      
      ## EXECUTION
      
      **Based on the PRD from this Chat:**
      
      1. Complete the Reasoning Protocol internally
      2. Synthesize the Visual Concept (spectrum + metaphor + name)
      3. Determine design communication approach based on PRD completeness
      4. Compress all content preserving meaning and authenticity
      5. Verify against Pre-Output checklist
      6. Output Phase 1 prompt only
      7. Await user request for Phase 2
      
      **Output Phase 1 immediately. Make informed inferences for industry conventions. Never invent business facts. Trust the AI Coder to implement your vision brilliantly.**

      ## Generate Phase 2: Premium Polish
      
      You previously generated a Phase 1 prompt for the Business from the PRD using the your design concept. The user has reviewed the implementation and is ready for the premium polish phase.
      
      ### Your Task
      
      Generate the Phase 2 prompt that elevates the existing implementation. Phase 2 focuses on:
      
      **Interaction & Motion**
      - Enhanced hover states (micro-interactions that feel alive)
      - Scroll-triggered animations (elements revealing with purpose)
      - State transitions (smooth, intentional feedback)
      
      **Visual Depth**
      - Layering and dimensional effects
      - Background visual interest (subtle patterns, gradients, atmospheric elements)  
      - Image integration refinements (soft edges, blending, contextual placement)
      
      **Delightful Details**
      - Moments of unexpected polish that elevate perception
      - Details that make the site feel crafted, not templated
      - Small touches aligned with the Visual Anchor mood
      
      ### Phase 2 Rules
      
      1. **Reference, don't redefine** — Use the existing Concept Name and Visual Anchor. Don't re-explain the design system.
      
      2. **Enhance, don't rebuild** — No structural changes, no new sections, no content changes.
      
      3. **Specific but not prescriptive** — Describe what interactions should *feel like*, not exact implementation code.
      
      4. **Prioritize impact** — Focus on 3-5 high-impact enhancements rather than exhaustive lists.
      
      5. **Stay on-brand** — All enhancements must feel consistent with the Visual Anchor metaphor.
      
      ### Phase 2 Output Format
      
      ```markdown
      # [BUSINESS NAME] — Phase 2: Premium Polish
      ## Enhancing "[Concept Name]"
      
      ### Interaction Enhancements
      [2-3 specific interaction improvements with intent descriptions]
      
      ### Motion Refinements  
      [2-3 animation enhancements that add life and purpose]
      
      ### Visual Depth Additions
      [1-2 layering or atmospheric enhancements]
      
      ### Detail Polish
      [1-2 small delightful touches]
      
      ━━━
      
      Refine the existing implementation with these enhancements. 
      Maintain the "[Visual Anchor metaphor]" feeling throughout.
      Do not change structure or content — only elevate the craft.
      ```
      
      ### Anti-Patterns (Avoid)
      
      - ❌ Repeating any content from Phase 1
      - ❌ Suggesting structural changes or new sections
      - ❌ Specifying exact CSS values or animation timings
      - ❌ Generic requests ("make it more modern")
      - ❌ Changes that contradict the Visual Anchor mood
